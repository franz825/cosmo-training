# Cosmo Training

## Purpose

This repository contains the didactic material for the exercise about cosmogenic radionuclide dating, in the frame of the training course in geochronology 2022.

## Schedule

### Before the training session

Read carefully the document "Technical considerations" available [here](guidelines/technical-considerations.md) or located in the `guidelines` directory. We expect that you read these guidelines **before** the practical session, especially if you do not have a Google account and are not willing to create one.

**Important Note**: We assume that everyone has access either to the interactive (Google Colab) or the local (Anaconda) Python environment before the beginning of the training session.

### During the training session

During the training session, browse the different notebooks available the `src` directory. Notebooks are numbered: `1_XXX`, `2_XXX`. So, follow the proper sequence.
