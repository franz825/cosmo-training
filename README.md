## Schedule

First, read carefully the document "Technical considerations" available [here](guidelines/technical-considerations.md) or located in the `guidelines` directory.
**Important Note**: We expect that you read these guidelines **before** the practical session, especially if you do not have a Google account and are not willing to create one.

Then, browse the different notebooks available the `src` directory. Notebooks are numbered: `1_XXX`, `2_XXX`. So, follow the proper sequence.
