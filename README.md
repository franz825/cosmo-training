# Cosmo Training

## Purpose

This repository contains the didactic material for the exercise about cosmogenic radionuclide dating, in the frame of the training course in geochronology 2022.

## Workflow

In order to achieve the exercises, you will use the "Google Colaboratory" interface, available [here](https://colab.research.google.com). This web interface enables you to interpret Jupyter Notebooks (text files containing a mix of text and code cells), written in the Python langage.
