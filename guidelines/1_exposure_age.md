# Exposure age calculation

A <sup>10</sup>Be concentration of 100 x 10Â³ at/g characterizes a shallow bedrock sample (Granite, density = 2.7). The production rate at SLHL is 1 at/g/yr. 10Be half live is 1.37 x 106 yrs. The bedrock is characterized with:

Calculate the exposure age for an erosion rate of 1, 2, 5, 10, and 50 m/Myr. How is the exposure age evolving in function of the erosion rate ? Why ?
