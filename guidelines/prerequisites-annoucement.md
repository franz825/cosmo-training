# Cosmo training

All the information related to the Cosmo training session is available in a Github repository:

[https://github.com/franz825/cosmo-training/](https://github.com/franz825/cosmo-training/) OR [https://bit.ly/cosmo-training](https://bit.ly/cosmo-training)

## Before the training session

We expect that everyone has access either to the interactive (Google Colab) or the local (Anaconda) Python environment **before** the beginning of the training session.

The complete technical guidelines are available in the document "[Technical considerations](https://github.com/franz825/cosmo-training/blob/main/guidelines/technical-considerations.md)" located in the `guidelines` directory of the repository. We expect that you read these guidelines before the practical session, especially if you do not have a Google account and are not willing to create one. A summary is provided below:

## Interactive environment

The easiest way to read and interpret Jupyter notebooks in the frame of this Cosmo Training sesssion is to use the "Google Colaboratory" (or Google Colab) interface.

If you have a Google account or if you accept to create one for the session, simply try to open the Google Colab interface in your browser: [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/).

If you can connect to the interface, you are all set for the training session.

## Local environment

If you do not have a Google account to connect to Google Colab and do not want to create one, you can run a Anaconda environment locally on your machine, to interpret Jupyter Notebooks.

The Anaconda environment is available for Windows, MacOS and Linux on this website: [https://www.anaconda.com/](https://www.anaconda.com/). The installation should be pretty straightforward as it is available as graphical installer. However, the installation files are pretty big (ca. 500 Mo !). So please plan ahead this technical step, for which we do not provide assistance as it is not the goal of the training course.

Once the installation process is done:

1. Open Anaconda and launch the Jupyter Notebook application.
2. In a dedicated directory on your machine, download the current Github repository from here: [https://bit.ly/cosmo-archive](https://bit.ly/cosmo-archive) and unzip the archive.
3. In your Jupyter environment, browse in your directory structure to find the local repository (the one you just downloaded) and open notebooks stored in the `src` directory.
